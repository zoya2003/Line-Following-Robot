# Line-Following-Robot
This project utilizes Arduino and Infrared (IR) sensors to create a smart and efficient robot that can autonomously follow a predefined path. The robot's brain is powered by an Arduino microcontroller and is equipped with IR sensors, which enable it to detect and follow lines on the ground.
